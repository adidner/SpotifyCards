TODO:



- dealing with titles or artists that are to long and need to be transfered into 2 lines
  - can grab size of text and check against whatever I think a good width is and then make it into 2 different lines from there
    if necessary and them calculate and use combined dimensions (or even put in a temp file and grab dimensions again)
  - also should look and seee if it has a - or () in it and try and split on that first. If that works it would be better do to
  - if it doesn't split the other way?

  - The math changes a bit with 3, take that into account




FINISHED:


- tiny bit of space between some album art and some spotify bars

- (feat. ) fitler
- remastered and / filter
